```bash
conda create -n infra python=3.10
conda activate infra
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set environment variables (.env file)**

```plaintext

APP_PASSWORD=your_16_digit_app_password
```

3. **Place the configuration file (config/config.yaml)**

### 🔥 How to Run

#### Run Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The FastAPI server will run at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) by default.

```

The Streamlit server will run at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) by default.

### ⚠️ Notes

This project is set up for demonstration purposes, so the model (agent), server, and frontend must all be run on the same local server.

If you want to use a cloud or another server, you need to configure the Public IP and ports accordingly.
